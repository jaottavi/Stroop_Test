# Stroop_Test
Udacity statistics project for Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Summary
This report investigates the results on an experiment called the *Stroop Test*. This test compares a persons ability to call out the color of the **ink** of two sets of words:

* *Congruent Words* - the word matches the color of the ink.
* *Incongruent Words* - the word does **not** match the color of the ink.

This analysis involves: identifying the different types of variables; crafting a hypothesis; describing and visualizing the data; and performing a statistical test.
